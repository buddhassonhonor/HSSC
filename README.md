# HSSC — Supplementary Materials (peer review)

This repository mirrors the Supplementary Information package (S1–S8) prepared to support peer review. It is intended to contain **supplementary materials only** and should not include author-identifying documents (e.g., cover letters, point-by-point responses) or the main manuscript source files.

See `supplementary/README.md` for the package contents.
