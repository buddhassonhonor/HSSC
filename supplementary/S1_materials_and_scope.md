# S1. Materials and scope conditions

This supplement summarizes the materials underpinning the manuscript’s mechanism-tracing analysis and the scope conditions stated in the “Materials and Analytic Strategy” section.

## Materials categories used in the analysis
1) **Policy documents and authoritative interpretations**  
Core policy materials from three reform waves: “Quality Education” (`suzhi jiaoyu`, 1990s–present), “Burden Reduction” (`jianfu`, multiple rounds since the 1980s), and “Double Reduction” (`shuangjian`, 2021). For each wave, the analysis considers: official texts, Ministry of Education interpretations, and local implementation guidelines.

2) **Secondary empirical evidence (peer-reviewed)**  
Peer-reviewed studies used to support claims about student stress/mental health, shadow education markets, perceptions of fairness, and reform implementation. An inventory is provided in `S2_secondary_evidence_inventory.csv`.

3) **Public reform narratives**  
Media reports, official speeches, and public discourse used to identify dominant semiotic framings of reforms and their reception.

## Scope conditions and limitations (as stated in the manuscript)
- The study synthesizes publicly available materials and published literature; it does not collect new primary data.
- The analysis is theory-driven and mechanism-tracing oriented; it specifies falsifiable predictions and observable indicators for future empirical tests.
- Claims are presented as interpretations grounded in cited evidence; causal inference is limited by reliance on secondary sources.
