56,tang2018prevalence,"China's exam-based selection regime has delivered high measured academic performance in selected assessments, yet it generates substantial negative externalities that have prompted decades of reform with limited durable change. The \textit{gaokao} (National College Entrance Examination) system dictates the rhythm of K-12 schooling, fostering an ""examination-oriented"" culture that has been linked to a mental health crisis among adolescents. Meta-analytic evidence indicates that approximately 25\% of Chinese secondary students report depressive symptoms \citep{tang2018prevalence}, with sleep deprivation and academic stress reaching endemic levels \citep{wang2020sleep, sun2015educational}."

58,zhao2014china,"Recognizing these costs, the Chinese government has launched successive waves of reform aiming to shift from ""examination-oriented education"" to ""quality education"" (\textit{suzhi jiaoyu}). These include the \textit{suzhi jiaoyu} reforms of the 1990s, recurring ""burden reduction"" (\textit{jianfu}) policies, and the stringent ""Double Reduction"" (\textit{shuangjian}) policy of 2021. Yet, a consistent pattern emerges: reforms are systematically absorbed, converted, or circumvented. ""Quality education"" initiatives were converted into new forms of competition, where arts and sports became resume-builders for admissions \citep{zhao2014china}. Burden reduction mandates were circumvented as pressure shifted to the private sector, fueling a large-scale shadow education industry \citep{zhang2017shadow}. Even the far-reaching Double Reduction policy, while dampening the visible tutoring market, triggered adaptive responses where competition relocated to underground or informal channels \citep{yu2021double}."

62,davey2007chinese,"Why does the system persist despite broad consensus on its harms and powerful political will to change it? Existing literature often attributes this failure to implementation gaps, lack of resources, or cultural resistance \citep{davey2007chinese}. While valid, these explanations tend to treat policy failure as a breakdown of execution rather than a systemic feature. They often overlook how the ""examination regime"" is stabilized by the interplay of meaning-making (how actors interpret fairness) and structural constraints (economic and political incentives). Valid critiques of the system abound, but there is a lack of a unified theoretical framework explaining the \textit{mechanisms} of its persistence and the specific ways reforms are neutralized."

88,kipnis2011governing,"\textit{Semiosis} refers to the process of meaning-making. In the context of education, semiotic imaginaries are the shared narratives and beliefs that frame how actors understand educational systems. In China, the dominant imaginary frames the \textit{gaokao} as the embodiment of meritocracy and procedural fairness. The narrative holds that ""exams are objective,"" ""scores cannot be faked,"" and ""everyone has a fair chance."" This imaginary draws on the 1,300-year legacy of the imperial examination (\textit{keju}), which embedded the cultural principle that examinations provide social mobility regardless of birth status \citep{kipnis2011governing}."
90,liu2016shadow,"Critically, this semiotic imaginary operates even when it contradicts empirical reality. Evidence shows that shadow education exacerbates inequality \citep{liu2016shadow}, yet the procedural appearance of fairness (standardized tests, numerical scores, transparent cutoffs) sustains belief in the system's legitimacy. As \citet{liu2016meritocracy} document, even families disadvantaged by the system express greater trust in exams than in alternative assessment methods like portfolios or interviews."

94,sumjessop2013,"\textit{Structuration} refers to the way institutions create constraints and incentives that shape actor behavior \citep{sumjessop2013}. In China's education system, the \textit{gaokao} is embedded in a network of institutional complementarities: labor markets screen by credentials from ranked universities; household registration (\textit{hukou}) systems restrict where students can take exams; social welfare and pension prospects correlate with educational attainment \citep{woronov2016class}. These structural dependencies mean that changing assessment methods would require simultaneous reforms across labor markets, welfare, and registration systems—a coordination challenge of immense complexity."

96,zhang2017shadow;bray2009confronting,"Furthermore, a large-scale shadow education industry (estimated at hundreds of billions of RMB annually) has emerged with powerful vested interests in maintaining the examination-centered system \citep{zhang2017shadow, bray2009confronting}. This industry lobbies against reforms that would diversify evaluation criteria, framing its opposition in the language of fairness: ""Comprehensive evaluation would advantage the rich."""
100,jessop2004cultural,"CPE explains institutional stability and change through the concept of \textit{selectivities}—the ways in which structures and discourses filter which ideas, policies, and practices are selected, retained, or discarded. We operationalize this through the Variation-Selection-Retention (V-S-R) mechanism \citep{jessop2004cultural}."
110,pierson2000increasing;north1990institutions,"We employ path dependence theory \citep{pierson2000increasing, north1990institutions} as a sub-framework within CPE to specify the mechanisms of lock-in. Path dependence refers to processes where historical choices constrain later options through self-reinforcing mechanisms. The 1977 restoration of the \textit{gaokao} after the Cultural Revolution represents a \textit{critical juncture}—a moment when institutional choices were made under specific historical conditions (post-Cultural Revolution desire for meritocracy, urgent need for talent selection). Once established, this choice triggered feedback loops that made reversal increasingly costly \citep{arthur1994increasing, sydow2009organizational}."

168,jessop2004cultural,"China's exam-based selection is not merely an assessment method but a \textit{governance regime}—a stable configuration of institutions, discourses, and practices that co-evolve to produce particular outcomes \citep{jessop2004cultural}. The regime is defined by: (1) a single high-stakes gatekeeping mechanism (the \textit{gaokao}); (2) a cascade of preparatory examinations (\textit{zhongkao}, district tests); (3) a massive complementary shadow education sector; (4) a labor market screening by university tier; and (5) a dominant cultural narrative of meritocratic fairness."

178,kipnis2011governing,"\textbf{Semiotic Layer.} The dominant narrative frames the \textit{gaokao} as the ""most fair"" selection mechanism in a low-trust society. This imaginary draws on the imperial examination legacy (\textit{keju}), which associated examinations with opportunity regardless of birth \citep{kipnis2011governing}. Key discursive markers include: ""scores cannot be faked,"" ""everyone takes the same test,"" and ""only ability matters."""
180,liu2016meritocracy,"\textbf{Structural Layer.} Alternative assessment methods (portfolios, interviews, comprehensive evaluation) are structurally disadvantaged. They require infrastructure (trained evaluators, standardized rubrics) that does not exist; they are vulnerable to corruption in low-trust contexts; they threaten vested interests (tutoring industry) that frame opposition as ""protecting fairness."" \citet{liu2016meritocracy} find that even disadvantaged families prefer examinations over alternatives they perceive as manipulable by elites."
188,bray2009confronting,"\textbf{Semiotic Layer.} The shadow education industry frames itself as providing ""equal opportunity through effort""—families who work harder and invest more can catch up. This narrative reinforces meritocracy while obscuring how investment capacity correlates with wealth \citep{bray2009confronting}."
190,zhang2017shadow;xue2020private,"\textbf{Structural Layer.} Various estimates describe a sizeable shadow-education market, though figures vary by definition and coverage. What matters for our argument is that the market is large enough to create durable vested interests and adaptive capacity \citep{zhang2017shadow, xue2020private}. Industry representatives argued that comprehensive evaluation ""would advantage wealthy families who can fabricate portfolios""—ironically, the industry whose existence advantages wealthy families positioned itself as defender of fairness."
192,bray2009confronting,"Shadow education converts economic capital into educational advantage \textit{invisibly}. When admission depends solely on test scores, the process appears procedurally fair; the role of purchased preparation remains hidden behind numerical results. This creates ""plausible deniability"" for inequality \citep{bray2009confronting}."
200,kipnis2011governing,"\textbf{Semiotic Layer.} The \textit{gaokao} is framed as a symbol of meritocratic governance and state capacity. Results from selected Chinese participating regions in international assessments have been mobilized as a legitimacy narrative, reinforcing confidence in exam-centred governance. Government reports emphasize how many rural students gained university access, framing the system as delivering social justice \citep{kipnis2011governing}."
202,davey2007chinese,"\textbf{Structural Layer.} The examination system is embedded in governance infrastructure: household registration (\textit{hukou}) restricts where students can test; university quotas vary by province for political reasons; key universities favor local students, creating political rewards for urban residents \citep{davey2007chinese}. Political incentives for officials tend to favour measurable stability and short-term performance over risky transformation. This creates systematic bias toward the status quo."
210,sun2015educational,"\textbf{Semiotic Layer.} Intensive academic pressure has become normalized as ""good parenting."" Parents describe feeling controlled by rather than controlling the system: ""I know this pressure is harmful, but what choice do I have?"" \citep{sun2015educational}. Social judgment reinforces participation: families who resist face accusations of ""not caring about the child's future."""
212,bray2009confronting,"\textbf{Structural Layer.} Families face a collective action trap \citep{bray2009confronting}. If only one family reduces pressure while others continue, that family's child falls behind in relative rankings. Coordinated reduction is impossible without enforceable commitment. Anxiety spreads through social networks: when neighbors' children attend tutoring, other families feel pressure to follow."
214,sun2015educational,"The one-child policy (1979-2015) intensified this dynamic by concentrating family aspirations on a single child. Limited social safety nets mean families bear full risk of educational ""failure."" Rapid economic change creates status anxiety—fear that children will fall behind in competitive labor markets \citep{sun2015educational}."

Schools added ""quality education"" classes while maintaining examination focus, effectively increasing rather than reducing student burden \citep{zhao2014china}. The reform's original intent was redirected to serve exam logic."
